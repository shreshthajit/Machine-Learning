## What is Recurrent Neural Network?
```
A recurrent neural network is a type of artificial neural network commonly used in speech recognition and natural
language processing. Recurrent neural networks recognize data's sequential characteristics and use patterns 
to predict the next likely scenario.
```

## Why Recurrent Neural Networks?
```
RNN were created because there were a few issues in the feed-forward neural network:

* Cannot handle sequential data
* Considers only the current input
* Cannot memorize previous inputs

The solution to these issues is the RNN. An RNN can handle sequential data, accepting the current input data, and 
previously received inputs. RNNs can memorize previous inputs due to their internal memory.

Types of Recurrent Neural Network:

```
1. One to One
2. One to many
3. Many to One
4. Many to Many
```
